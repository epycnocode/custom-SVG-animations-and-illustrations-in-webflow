# Webflow SVG Magic: Add Personality and Dynamism with Custom Animations & Illustrations

Imagine your Webflow site bursting with vibrant personality and interactive elements. That's the power of custom SVG animations and illustrations! These vector graphics can bring your design to life, adding dynamism and engaging your visitors in a way static images never could. Here's how you can get started, with a clean code example:

**1. SVG Superpowers:**

  - **Lightweight & scalable:** SVGs are code-based, making them lightweight and adaptable to any screen size without losing quality.
  - **Infinitely customizable:** Animate individual elements, change colors, or even morph shapes to create captivating visual experiences.
  - **Unique & expressive:** Design custom illustrations that perfectly match your brand and add a touch of personality to your site.

**2. Unleashing the SVG Magic:**

  - **Webflow Interactions:** Use Webflow's built-in Interactions feature to apply animation triggers like scroll, hover, or click to your SVGs.
  - **External libraries:** Explore libraries like Anime.js or Lottie for more complex animation control and effects.
  - **Code injection:** Inject custom JavaScript code to create truly unique and interactive SVG experiences.

**3. Short & Clean Code Example:**

Let's animate a simple SVG circle to pulsate when hovered over:

**HTML:**
```
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="#ff69b4" />
</svg>

```
**CSS:**

```
circle {
  transition: transform ease-in-out 0.5s;
}

circle:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}

```
